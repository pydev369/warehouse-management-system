# README: Supply Chain Ideation Process

## Objective
To streamline and automate the supply chain inventory stock transfer and warehouse distribution processes while reducing manual dependencies and errors.

## Goals
1. Centralize all SKU, batch, and regional data into a single source of truth.
2. Automate allocation logic for different SKU categories.
3. Build real-time monitoring dashboards with dynamic alerts.
4. Create resilient processes for handling exceptions like expired stock or shipment delays.

## Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**
   - Identified pain points: manual allocation, mismatched stock tracking, lack of real-time monitoring.
   - Categorized SKUs into logical groups based on allocation rules.
2. **Defining the Workflow**
   - Broken down into data ingestion, logic implementation, monitoring, and exception handling.
3. **Selecting Tools**
   - Python, SQL for data processing.
   - Grafana for monitoring and alerting.
4. **Agile Execution**
   - Tasks divided into sprints for incremental progress.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas), SQLAlchemy
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Alerting**: Slack, AWS SNS
- **Flow Diagrams**: Mermaid for process visualization

## Outputs
- Automated allocation scripts.
- Centralized database for all supply chain data.
- Real-time dashboards for stock monitoring.
- Exception handling for critical scenarios.
